In many OCR scenarios, we're interested in extracting tabular data from an image scan. Regular OCR often fails at this task, returning the content of the table simply as lines with numbers instead of as structured data. But the Google Document AI ecosystem has specialised processors with powerful form parsing and table extraction capabilities, most of which can be leveraged in R with `daiR`.

To extract table data from a PDF or an image, we use the core functions `dai_sync()` and `dai_async` as we would with text (see the vignette on [basic use](https://dair.info/articles/usage.html)), except we need to use a processor of type `FORM_PARSER_PROCESSOR` instead of the default type `OCR_PROCESSOR`.[^deprecated] We then use the function `get_tables()` on the response object or JSON file, in much the same way as we would with `get_text()`.  

[^deprecated]: This way of getting tables was introduced in early 2024. Before then, the process involved calling another API endpoint (`v1beta2`), which is why `daiR` used to have a separate set of functions to deal with tables. On 31 January 2024, Google discontinued the `v1beta2` endpoint, making these functions obsolete. As a result, `dai_sync_tab()` and `dai_async_tab()` have been made defunct, while `tables_from_dai_response()` and `tables_from_dai_file()` have been deprecated.

## Activating a form parser processor

The first step toward extracting tables is to activate a processor of type `FORM_PARSER_PROCESSOR`. Depending on your use history, you may or may not have such a processor available already. You can check with the following code. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
processors <- get_processors()
any(grep("FORM_PARSER", processors$type))
```

If this yields `TRUE`, you have one or more form parser processors already. Assuming you only have one[^more], you can store the id in a variable like so:

[^more]: If you have more than one form parser processor, `formparser_id` will contain more than one id. If so, either pick the first and best by running `formparser_id <- formparser_id[1]` or choose a specific one manually and assign it to the variable `formparser_id`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
formparser_id <- unique(processors$id[processors$type == "FORM_PARSER_PROCESSOR"])
```

If the earlier command yielded `FALSE`, you don't have a form parser processor, and you must create one. This is very easy to do. Just run the following command, adding a unique name for your processor. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
formparser_id <- create_processor("<unique_chosen_name>", type = "FORM_PARSER_PROCESSOR")
```

If the processor name has been taken, you will get an error to this effect. If so, just retry with another name. When successful, `create_processor()` returns the id of the created processor, and we can capture it in the variable `formparser_id`. Double check that it worked by viewing its content:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
formparser_id
```

If still in doubt, run `get_processors()` again and eyeball the output. The new form parser model should be there. 

## Synchronous processing with form parsers

Now that you have the id of an active form parser processor stored in the variable `formparser_id`, you are ready to process documents with it. 

Let us test it on a pdf from the so-called [Truth Tobacco Industry Documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Tobacco_Industry_Documents), which contains four tables like this: 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("tobacco.PNG")
```

First we download it:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd(tempdir())
url <- "https://archive.org/download/tobacco_lpnn0000/lpnn0000.pdf"
download.file(url, "tobacco.pdf")
```

All you now need to do is to run a regular `dai_sync()` command, supplying the id of your form parser processor in the `proc_id` parameter. Since it's a four-page document, it may take 20-30 seconds to process.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
resp <- dai_sync("tobacco.pdf", proc_id = formparser_id)
```

We can then pass the response object to `get_tables()`, which will return a list with all the tables it found.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tables <- get_tables(resp)
```

Running `length(tables)` suggests the list contains four tables, which corresponds to the number of pages in the PDF. We can inspect them individually like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(tables[[1]])
```

Or we can import them all into our global environment with `assign()`, as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for(i in seq_along(tables)) {
  assign(paste0("table", i), tables[[i]])
}
```

Or we can save them all to `.csv` files like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for(i in seq_along(tables)) {
  filename <- paste0("table", i, ".csv")
  write.csv(tables[[i]], filename, row.names = FALSE)
}
```


Either way, the result is pretty good. Here's what the first table looks like in my RStudio before any cleaning:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("table.PNG")
```


## Asynchronous processing with form parsers

Asynchronous processing is very similar. First we upload the file to a storage bucket:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(googleCloudStorageR)
gcs_upload("tobacco.pdf")
```

Then we check that it arrived.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
gcs_list_objects()
```

Then we pass the filename to `dai_async`, specifying that we want the form parser processor to be applied. We also run `dai_notify()` so we get a beep when the JSON file is ready (it should take about 30 seconds).
 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
resp <- dai_async("tobacco.pdf", proc_id = formparser_id)
dai_notify(resp)
```

Then we download the JSON file. There probably aren't many other JSON files containing the word "tobacco" in the bucket , so a quick Regex should find it.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
contents <- gcs_list_objects()
our_json <- grep("tobacco.*json", contents$name, value = TRUE)
gcs_get_object(our_json, saveToDisk = "tobacco.json")
```

Finally we supply the file to `get_tables()`, just making sure to add `type = "async"`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tables <- get_tables("tobacco.json", type = "async")
```

That's all there is to it.

## How good is it?

Most of the time you should get pretty good results. Don't expect perfection, but do expect something that you can quickly clean up manually in Excel. However, the quality of the output varies, depending on a variety of factors, including 

- the language (it works best on English)
- the complexity of the table (row and column spans are challenging) 
- the amount of visual noise in the original document
- the resolution of the image passed to Document AI. 

For optimal results, use a high-resolution scan, crop the image to remove everything except the table, and process asynchronously.
